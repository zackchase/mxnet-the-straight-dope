    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we could begin writing,\n",
    "the authors of this book, \n",
    "like much of the work force, \n",
    "had to become caffeinated. \n",
    "We hopped in the car and started driving.\n",
    "Having an Android, Alex called out \"Okay Google\",\n",
    "awakening the phone's voice recognition system.\n",
    "Then Mu commanded \"directions to Blue Bottle coffee shop\".\n",
    "The phone quickly displayed the transcription of his command.\n",
    "It also recognized that we were asking for directions \n",
    "and launched the Maps application to fullfil our request. \n",
    "Once launched, the Maps app identified a number of routes. \n",
    "Next to each route, the phone displayed a predicted transit time.\n",
    "While we fabricated this story for pedagogical convenience,\n",
    "it demonstrates that in the span of just a few seconds, \n",
    "our everyday interactions with a smartphone\n",
    "can engage several machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If you've never worked with machine learning before,\n",
    "you might be wondering what the hell we're talking about. \n",
    "You might ask, \"Isn't that just programming?\"\n",
    "Or, \"What does *machine learning* even mean?\"\n",
    "First, to be clear, we implement all machine learning algorithms \n",
    "by writing computer programs. \n",
    "And we use many of the same languages and hardware \n",
    "as used in other fields of computer science, \n",
    "as varied as graphics and computational fluid dynamics.\n",
    "But not all computer programs involve machine learning. \n",
    "In response to the second question, \n",
    "precisely defining a field of study \n",
    "as vast as machine learning is hard. \n",
    "It's a bit like answering, \"what is math?\". \n",
    "But we'll try to give you enough intuition to get started.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## A motivating example \n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the computer programs we interact with every day can be coded up from first principles.\n",
    "When you add an item to your shopping cart, you trigger an ecommerce application to store an entry in a *shopping cart* database table, associating your user ID with the product's ID. We can write such a program from first principles, launch without ever having seen a real customer. And when it's this easy to write an application *you should not be using machine learning*. \n",
    "\n",
    "But fortunately (for the community of ML scientists), most applications are not this easy.\n",
    "Returning to our fake story about going to get coffee,\n",
    "imagine just writing a program to respond to a *wake word* \n",
    "like \"Alexa\", \"Okay, Google\" or \"Siri\".\n",
    "Try coding it up in a room by yourself with nothing but a computer and a code editor. \n",
    "How would you write such a program from first principles?\n",
    "Think about it... the problem is not trivial.\n",
    "Every second, microphones collect roughly 44,000 samples.\n",
    "What rule could map reliably from a snippet of raw audio to confident predictions ``{yes, no}`` \n",
    "on whether the snippet contains the wake word?\n",
    "If you're stuck, don't worry. \n",
    "We don't know how to write such a program from scratch either. \n",
    "That's why we use machine learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the trick. \n",
    "Even if we don't know how to tell a computer \n",
    "to map snippets to predictions,\n",
    "we ourselves are capable of performing this cognitive feat.\n",
    "As a result, we can collect a huge *data set* containing examples of audio\n",
    "and label those that *do* and that *do not* contain the wake word.\n",
    "In the machine learning approach, we do not directly design a system to recognize \n",
    "wake words right away. \n",
    "Instead, we define a flexible program whose behavior is allowed to change over the course of a *training period*. \n",
    "The job of this program is to learn from examples. \n",
    "Thus rather than code up a wake word recognizer, \n",
    "we would code up a program which, *when presented with a large labeled dataset*, \n",
    "can recognize wake words. \n",
    "You can think of this act,\n",
    "of determining a program's behavior by presenting it with a dataset,\n",
    "as *programming with data*.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The dizzying versatility of machine learning\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the core idea behind machine learning. \n",
    "Rather than code programs with fixed behavior,\n",
    "we design programs with the ability to improve at some task \n",
    "as a function of their experience. \n",
    "The machine learning approach encompasses many different problem formulations, \n",
    "can involve many different algorithms, \n",
    "and can address many different application domains.\n",
    "In this particular case, we described an instance of *supervised learning* \n",
    "applied to a problem in automated speech recognition. \n",
    "\n",
    "Machine Learning is a versatile set of tools that lets you work with data in many different situations where simple rule-based systems would fail or might be very difficult to build. Due to its versatility, machine learning can be quite confusing to newcomers.\n",
    "For example, machine learning techniques are already widely used\n",
    "in applications as diverse as search engines, self driving cars, \n",
    "machine translation, medical diagnosis, spam filtering, \n",
    "game playing (*chess*, *go*), face recognition, \n",
    "date matching, calculating insurance premiums, and adding filters to photos. \n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the superficial differences between these problems many of them share common structure\n",
    "and are addressable with deep learning tools. \n",
    "They're mostly because they are problems where coding we wouldn't be able program their behavior directly in code, \n",
    "but we can *program with data*.\n",
    "Oftentimes the most direct language for communicating these kinds of programs is *math*. \n",
    "In this book we'll introduce a minimal amount of mathematical notation,\n",
    "but unlike other books on machine learning and neural networks,\n",
    "we'll always keep the conversation grounded in real examples and real code.\n",
    "To make this conversation more concrete, let's consider a few examples and start writing some code."

The interviewer asked him to code up Fizz Buzz. This is a children's game where the players count from 1 to 100 and will say *'fizz'* whenever the number is divisible by 3, *'buzz'* whenever it is divisible by 5, and *'fizzbuzz'* whenever it satisfies both criteria.

    "## Bare bones machine learning\n",
    "\n",
    "To succeed at machine learning, we need four things: data, a model of how to transform the data, a loss function to measure how well we're doing, and an algorithm to tweak the model parameters such that the loss function is minimized. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Data.** The more the better. Data is at the heart of the resurgence of deep learning, since complex nonlinear models require lots of it to work well. Here are some examples.\n",
    "     * Images, e.g. pictures taken by your phone (cats, dogs, dinosaurs, high school reunions, dentist's X-Ray images, satellite images, ...)\n",
    "     * Text, e.g. emails, high school essays, tweets, news articles\n",
    "     * Sound, e.g. voice commands sent to an Echo, audio books, phone calls\n",
    "     * Video, e.g. movies, home surveillance, multi-camera tracking, ...\n",
    "     * Structured data, e.g. this Jupyter notebook (it contains text, images, code), a webpage, car rental records, your electricity bill, ...\n",
    "* **Model.** Usually the data looks quite different from what we want to accomplish with it. E.g. we might have photos of people and want to know whether they're happy. Hence, we need to turn a 10 megapixel image into a probability of happiness. For this, we need to apply a number of (typically) nonlinear transformations $f$, e.g. by defining a network.\n",
    "* **Loss function.** To assess how well we're doing we need to compare the output from the model with the truth. Loss functions allow us to determine whether a stock prediction of \\$1,500 for ``AMZN`` by December 31, 2017 is correct. Depending on whether we decided to go short or long on it, we would incur different losses (or realize profits), hence our loss functions might be quite different. \n",
    "* **Training.** Usually models have many parameters. These are the ones that we need to 'learn', by minimizing the loss incurred on training data. Unfortunately, doing well on the latter doesn't guarantee that we will do well on (unseen) test data, as the analogy below illustrates.\n",
    "     * **Training Error** - This is the error on the dataset used to find $f$ by minimizing the loss on the training set. This is equivalent to doing well on all the practice exams that a student might use to prepare for the real exam. Encouraging but by no means a guarantee.\n",
    "     * **Test Error** - This is the error incurred on an unseen test set. This can be off by quite a bit (statisticians call this overfitting). In real-life terms this is the equivalent of screwing up the real exam despite doing well on the practice exams.\n",

    "\n",
    "This is one of the simplest tasks. Given data $x \\in X$, such as images, text, sound, video, medical diagnostics, performance of a car, motion sensor data, etc., we want to answer the question as to which class $y \\in Y$ the data belongs to. In the above case, $X$ are images and $Y = \\mathrm{\\{cat, dog\\}}$. Quite often the confidence of the classifier, i.e. the algorithm that does this, is expressed in the form of probabilities, e.g. $\\Pr(y=\\mathrm{cat}\\mid x) = 0.9$, i.e. the classifier is 90% sure that it's a cat. Whenever we have only two possible outcomes, statisticians call this a *binary classifier*. All other cases are called *multiclass classification*, e.g. the digits `[0, 1, 2, 3 ... 9]` in a digit recognition task. In `MXNet Gluon` the corresponding loss function is the [Cross Entropy Loss](http://mxnet.io/api/python/gluon.html#mxnet.gluon.loss.SoftmaxCrossEntropyLoss). \n",

Nonetheless, very few people would be foolhardy enough to eat it, after all, the certain benefit of a delicious dinner isn't worth the potential risk of dying from it. In other words, the effect of the *uncertain risk* by far outweighs the benefit. Let's look at this in math. Basically we need to compute the expected risk that we incur, i.e. we need to multiply the probability of the outcome with the benefit (or harm) associated with it:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$L(\\mathrm{action}\\mid x) = \\mathbf{E}_{y \\sim p(y\\mid x)}[\\mathrm{loss}(\\mathrm{action},y)]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, the loss $L$ incurred by eating the mushroom is $L(a=\\mathrm{eat}\\mid x) = 0.2 * \\infty + 0.8 * 0 = \\infty$, whereas the cost of discarding it is $L(a=\\mathrm{discard}\\mid x) = 0.2 * 0 + 0.8 * 1 = 0.8$. We got lucky - as any botanist would tell us, the above actually *is* a death cap.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are way more fancy classification problems than the ones above. For instance, we might have hierarchies. One of the first examples of such a thing are due to Linnaeus, who applied it to animals. Usually this is referred to as *hierarchical classification*. Typically the cost of misclassification depends on how far you've strayed from the truth, e.g. mistaking a poodle for a schnautzer is no big deal but mistaking it for a dinosaur would be embarrassing. On the other hand, mistaking a rattle snake for a garter snake could be deadly. In other words, the cost might be *nonuniform* over the hierarchy of classes but tends to increase the further away you are from the truth. \n",

But this is problematic, too, since there are just so many tags (often hundreds of thousands or millions) that could apply, e.g. `(ham, green eggs, spam, grinch, ...)` and we would have to *check* all of them and to ensure that they are all accurate. \n",

You can now both team up and perform a regression estimate to identify the contractor's pricing structure: \\$100 per hour plus \\$50 to show up at your house.

In other words, if we are asked to produce the first 5 letters from the alphabet, there is a difference between returning ``A B C D E`` and ``C A B E D``. Even if the result set is the same, the ordering within the set matters nonetheless.\n",

Instead, it simply helped to order the results that contained the query terms. Nowadays search engines use machine learning and behavioral models to obtain query-dependent relevance scores.

Generally, such systems strive to estimate some score $y_{ij}$ as a function of user $u_i$ and object $o_j$. The objects $o_j$ with the largest scores $y_{ij}$ are then used as recommendation.

    "## Unsupervised learning\n",
    "\n",
    "All the examples so far are related to *Supervised Learning*, i.e. situations where we know what we want. Quite often, though, we simply want to learn as much about the data as possible. This sounds vague because it is. The type and number of questions we could ask is only limited by the creativity of the statistician asking the question. We will address a number of them later in this tutorial where we will provide matching examples. To whet your appetite, we list a few of them below:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Is there a small number of prototypes that accurately summarize the data. E.g. given a set of photos, can we group  them into landscape photos, pictures of dogs, babies, cats, mountain peaks, etc.? Likewise, given a collection of users (with their behavior), can we group them into users with similar behavior? This problem is typically known as **clustering**.\n",
    "* Is there a small number of parameters that accurately captures the relevant properties of the data? E.g. the trajectories of a ball are quite well described by velocity, diameter and mass of the ball. Tailors have developed a small number of parameters that describe human body shape fairly accurately for the purpose of fitting clothes. These problems are referred to as **subspace estimation** problems. If the dependence is linear, it is called **principal component analysis**.\n",
    "* Is there a representation of (arbitrary structured) objects in Euclidean space (i.e. the space of vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^n$) such that symbolic properties can be well matched? This is called **representation learning** and it is used, to describe entities and their relations such as Rome - Italy + France = Paris. \n",
    "* Is there a description of the root causes of much of the data that we observe? For instance, if we have demographic data about house prices, pollution, crime, location, education, salaries, etc., can we discover how they are related simply based on empirical data? The field of **directed graphical models** and **causality** deals with this.\n",
    "* An important and exciting recent development are **generative adversarial networks**. They are basically a procedural way of synthesizing data. The underlying statistical mechanisms are tests to check whether real and fake data are the same. We will devote a few notebooks to them. \n"

    "## Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we didn't discuss at all yet, where all the data comes from, how we need to interact with the environment, whether it remembers what we did previously, if the environment wants to help us (e.g. a user reading text into a speech recognizer) or if it is out to beat us (e.g. in a game), or if it doesn't care (in most cases). Those problems are usually distinguished by monikers such as batch learning, online learning, control, and reinforcement learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "We also didn't discuss what happens when training and test data are different (statisticians call this covariate shift). This is a problem that most of us will have experienced painfully when taking exams written by the lecturer, while the homeworks were composed by his TAs. Likewise, there is a large area of situations where we want our tools to be robust against malicious or malformed training data (robustness) or equally abnormal test data. We will introduce these aspects gradually throughout this tutorial to help practitioners deal with them in their work. "
