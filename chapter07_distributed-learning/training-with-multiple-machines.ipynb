    "# Distributed training with multiple machines\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous two tutorials, we saw \n",
    "that using multiple GPUs within a machine \n",
    "can accelerate training. \n",
    "The speedup, however, is limited \n",
    "by the number of GPUs installed in that machine.\n",
    "And it's rare to find a single machine with more than 16 GPUs nowadays. \n",
    "For some truly large-scale applications, \n",
    "this speedup might still be insufficient.\n",
    "For example, it could still take many days \n",
    "to train a state-of-the-art CNN on millions of images.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we'll discuss the key concepts you'll need \n",
    "in order to go from a program that does single-machine training\n",
    "to one that executes distributed training across multiple machines. \n",
    "We depict a typical distributed system in the following figure, where\n",
    "multiple machines are connected by network switches.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](../img/multi-machines.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the way we used `copyto` to copy data from one GPU to another in the [multiple-GPU tutorial](../multiple-gpus-scratch.ipynb) does not work when our GPUs are sitting on different machines. To make use of the available resources here well need a better abstraction."
