    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we could begin writing,\n",
    "the authors of this book, \n",
    "like much of the work force, \n",
    "had to become caffeinated. \n",
    "We hopped in the car and started driving.\n",
    "Having an Android, Alex called out \"Okay Google\",\n",
    "awakening the phone's voice recognition system.\n",
    "Then Mu commanded \"directions to Blue Bottle coffee shop\".\n",
    "The phone quickly displayed the transcription of his command.\n",
    "It also recognized that we were asking for directions \n",
    "and launched the Maps application to fulfill our request. \n",
    "Once launched, the Maps app identified a number of routes. \n",
    "Next to each route, the phone displayed a predicted transit time.\n",
    "While we fabricated this story for pedagogical convenience,\n",
    "it demonstrates that in the span of just a few seconds, \n",
    "our everyday interactions with a smartphone\n",
    "can engage several machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If you've never worked with machine learning before,\n",
    "you might be wondering what the hell we're talking about. \n",
    "You might ask, \"isn't that just programming?\"\n",
    "or \"what does *machine learning* even mean?\"\n",
    "First, to be clear, we implement all machine learning algorithms \n",
    "by writing computer programs. \n",
    "Indeed, we use the same languages and hardware \n",
    "as other fields of computer science,\n",
    "but not all computer programs involve machine learning. \n",
    "In response to the second question, \n",
    "precisely defining a field of study \n",
    "as vast as machine learning is hard. \n",
    "It's a bit like answering, \"what is math?\". \n",
    "But we'll try to give you enough intuition to get started.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## A motivating example \n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the computer programs we interact with every day \n",
    "can be coded up from first principles.\n",
    "When you add an item to your shopping cart, \n",
    "you trigger an e-commerce application to store an entry \n",
    "in a *shopping cart* database table, \n",
    "associating your user ID with the product's ID. \n",
    "We can write such a program from first principles, \n",
    "launch without ever having seen a real customer.\n",
    "When it's this easy to write an application \n",
    "*you should not be using machine learning*. \n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately (for the community of ML scientists), however, \n",
    "for many problems, solutions aren't so easy.\n",
    "Returning to our fake story about going to get coffee,\n",
    "imagine just writing a program to respond to a *wake word* \n",
    "like \"Alexa\", \"Okay, Google\" or \"Siri\".\n",
    "Try coding it up in a room by yourself \n",
    "with nothing but a computer and a code editor. \n",
    "How would you write such a program from first principles?\n",
    "Think about it... the problem is hard.\n",
    "Every second, the microphone will collect roughly 44,000 samples.\n",
    "What rule could map reliably from a snippet of raw audio \n",
    "to confident predictions ``{yes, no}`` \n",
    "on whether the snippet contains the wake word?\n",
    "If you're stuck, don't worry. \n",
    "We don't know how to write such a program from scratch either. \n",
    "That's why we use machine learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "![](../img/wake-word.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the trick. \n",
    "Often, even when we don't know how to tell a computer \n",
    "explicitly how to map from inputs to outputs,\n",
    "we are nonetheless capable of performing the cognitive feat ourselves.\n",
    "In other words, even if you don't know *how to program a computer* to recognize the word \"Alexa\",\n",
    "you yourself *are able* to recognize the word \"Alexa\". \n",
    "Armed with this ability, \n",
    "we can collect a huge *data set* containing examples of audio\n",
    "and label those that *do* and that *do not* contain the wake word.\n",
    "In the machine learning approach, we do not design a system *explicitly* to recognize \n",
    "wake words right away. \n",
    "Instead, we define a flexible program with a number of *parameters*. \n",
    "These are knobs that we can tune to change the behavior of the program.\n",
    "We call this program a model.\n",
    "Generally, our model is just a machine that transforms its input into some output.\n",
    "In this case, the model receives as *input* a snippet of audio,\n",
    "and it generates as output an answer ``{yes, no}``,\n",
    "which we hope reflects whether (or not) the snippet contains the wake word.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we choose the right kind of model, \n",
    "then there should exist one setting of the knobs\n",
    "such that the model fires ``yes`` every time it hears the word \"Alexa\".\n",
    "There should also be another setting of the knobs that might fire ``yes`` \n",
    "on the word \"Apricot\". \n",
    "We expect that the same model should apply to \"Alexa\" recognition and \"Apricot\" recognition\n",
    "because these are similar tasks. \n",
    "However, we might need a different model to deal with fundamentally different inputs or outputs. \n",
    "For example, we might choose a different sort of machine to map from images to captions,\n",
    "or from English sentences to Chinese sentences. \n",
    "\n",
    "As you might guess, if we just set the knobs randomly,\n",
    "the model will probably recognize neither \"Alexa\", \"Apricot\",\n",
    "nor any other English word. \n",
    "Generally, in deep learning, the *learning*\n",
    "refers precisely \n",
    "to updating the model's behavior (by twisting the knobs)\n",
    "over the course of a *training period*. \n",
    "\n",
    "The training process usually looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start off with a randomly initialized model that can't do anything useful.\n",
    "1. Grab some of your labeled data (e.g. audio snippets and corresponding ``{yes,no}`` labels)\n",
    "1. Tweak the knobs so the model sucks less with respect to those examples\n",
    "1. Repeat until the model is awesome.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](../img/ml-loop.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize, rather than code up a wake word recognizer, \n",
    "we code up a program that can *learn* to recognize wake words, \n",
    "*if we present it with a large labeled dataset*.\n",
    "You can think of this act\n",
    "of determining a program's behavior by presenting it with a dataset\n",
    "as *programming with data*.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can 'program' a cat detector by providing our machine learning system with many examples of cats and dogs, such as the images below:\n",
    "\n",
    "|![](../img/cat1.jpg)|![](../img/cat2.jpg)|![](../img/dog1.jpg)|![](../img/dog2.jpg)|\n",
    "|:---------------:|:---------------:|:---------------:|:---------------:|\n",
    "|cat|cat|dog|dog|\n",
    "\n",
    "This way the detector will eventually learn to emit a very large positive number if it's a cat, a very large negative number if it's a dog, and something closer to zero if it isn't sure, but this is just barely scratching the surface of what machine learning can do.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The dizzying versatility of machine learning\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the core idea behind machine learning:\n",
    "Rather than code programs with fixed behavior,\n",
    "we design programs with the ability to improve\n",
    "as they acquire more experience. \n",
    "This basic idea can take many forms.\n",
    "Machine learning can address many different application domains, \n",
    "involve many different types of models,\n",
    "and update them according to many different learning algorithms.\n",
    "In this particular case, we described an instance of *supervised learning* \n",
    "applied to a problem in automated speech recognition. \n",
    "\n",
    "Machine Learning is a versatile set of tools that lets you work with data in many different situations where simple rule-based systems would fail or might be very difficult to build. Due to its versatility, machine learning can be quite confusing to newcomers.\n",
    "For example, machine learning techniques are already widely used\n",
    "in applications as diverse as search engines, self driving cars, \n",
    "machine translation, medical diagnosis, spam filtering, \n",
    "game playing (*chess*, *go*), face recognition, \n",
    "data matching, calculating insurance premiums, and adding filters to photos. \n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the superficial differences between these problems many of them share a common structure\n",
    "and are addressable with deep learning tools. \n",
    "They're mostly similar because they are problems where we wouldn't be able to program their behavior directly in code, \n",
    "but we can *program them with data*.\n",
    "Often times the most direct language for communicating these kinds of programs is *math*. \n",
    "In this book, we'll introduce a minimal amount of mathematical notation,\n",
    "but unlike other books on machine learning and neural networks,\n",
    "we'll always keep the conversation grounded in real examples and real code.\n",

    "## Basics of machine learning\n",
    "When we considered the task of recognizing wake-words, \n",
    "we put together a dataset consisting of snippets and labels.\n",
    "We then described (albeit abstractly) \n",
    "how you might train a machine learning model\n",
    "to predict the label given a snippet. \n",
    "This set-up, predicting labels from examples, is just one flavor of ML \n",
    "and it's called *supervised learning*. \n",
    "Even within deep learning, there are many other approaches, \n",
    "and we'll discuss each in subsequent sections. \n",
    "To get going with machine learning, we need four things: \n",
    "     \n",
    "1. Data\n",
    "2. A model of how to transform the data\n",
    "3. A loss function to measure how well we're doing\n",
    "4. An algorithm to tweak the model parameters such that the loss function is minimized\n",
    "     \n",
    "### Data \n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, the more data we have, the easier our job becomes. \n",
    "When we have more data, we can train more powerful models. Data is at the heart of the resurgence of deep learning and many of most exciting models in deep learning don't work without large data sets. Here are some examples of the kinds of data machine learning practitioners often engage with:\n",
    "     \n",
    "* **Images:** Pictures taken by smartphones or harvested from the web, satellite images, photographs of medical conditions, ultrasounds, and radiologic images like CT scans and MRIs, etc. \n",
    "* **Text:** Emails, high school essays, tweets, news articles, doctor's notes, books, and corpora of translated sentences, etc.\n",
    "* **Audio:** Voice commands sent to smart devices like Amazon Echo, or iPhone or Android phones, audio books, phone calls, music recordings, etc.\n",
    "* **Video:** Television programs and movies, YouTube videos, cell phone footage, home surveillance, multi-camera tracking, etc.\n",
    "* **Structured data:** Webpages, electronic medical records, car rental records, electricity bills, etc.\n",
    "     \n",
    "### Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually the data looks quite different from what we want to accomplish with it. \n",
    "For example, we might have photos of people and want to know whether they appear to be happy. \n",
    "We might desire a model capable of ingesting a high-resolution image and outputting a happiness score. \n",
    "While some simple problems might be addressable with simple models, we're asking a lot in this case. \n",
    "To do its job, our happiness detector needs to transform hundreds of thousands of low-level features (pixel values) \n",
    "into something quite abstract on the other end (happiness scores). \n",
    "Choosing the right model is hard, and different models are better suited to different datasets. \n",
    "In this book, we'll be focusing mostly on deep neural networks. \n",
    "These models consist of many successive transformations of the data that are chained together top to bottom, \n",
    "thus the name *deep learning*. \n",
    "On our way to discussing deep nets, we'll also discuss some simpler, shallower models. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Loss functions \n",
    "\n",
    "To assess how well we're doing we need to compare the output from the model with the truth. \n",
    "Loss functions give us a way of measuring how *bad* our output is.\n",
    "For example, say we trained a model to infer a patient's heart rate from images.\n",
    "If the model predicted that a patient's heart rate was 100bpm, \n",
    "when the ground truth was actually 60bpm,\n",
    "we need a way to communicate to the model that it's doing a lousy job.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly if the model was assigning scores to emails indicating the probability that they are spam,\n",
    "we'd need a way of telling the model when its predictions are bad. \n",
    "Typically the *learning* part of machine learning consists of minimizing this loss function.\n",
    "Usually, models have many parameters. \n",
    "The best values of these parameters is what we need to 'learn', typically by minimizing the loss incurred on a *training data*\n",
    "of observed data. \n",
    "Unfortunately, doing well on the training data \n",
    "doesn't guarantee that we will do well on (unseen) test data, \n",
    "so we'll want to keep track of two quantities.\n",
    "\n",
    " * **Training Error:** This is the error on the dataset used to train our model by minimizing the loss on the training set. This is equivalent to doing well on all the practice exams that a student might use to prepare for the real exam. The results are encouraging, but by no means guarantee success on the final exam.\n",
    " * **Test Error:** This is the error incurred on an unseen test set. This can deviate quite a bit from the training error. This condition, when a model fails to generalize to unseen data, is called *overfitting*. In real-life terms, this is the equivalent of screwing up the real exam despite doing well on the practice exams.\n",
    "     \n",
    "\n",
    "### Optimization algorithms     \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, to minimize the loss, we'll need some way of taking the model and its loss functions, \n",
    "and searching for a set of parameters that minimizes the loss.\n",
    "The most popular optimization algorithms for work on neural networks\n",
    "follow an approach called gradient descent. \n",
    "In short, they look to see, for each parameter which way the training set loss would move if you jiggled the parameter a little bit. They then update the parameter in the direction that reduces the loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following sections, we will discuss a few types of machine learning in some more detail. We begin with a list of *objectives*, i.e. a list of things that machine learning can do. Note that the objectives are complemented with a set of techniques of *how* to accomplish them, i.e. training, types of data, etc. The list below is really only sufficient to whet the readers' appetite and to give us a common language when we talk about problems. We will introduce a larger number of such problems as we go along. "

    "## Supervised learning \n",
    "\n",
    "Supervised learning addresses the task of predicting *targets* given input data.\n",
    "The targets, also commonly called *labels* are generally denoted *y*.\n",
    "The input data points, also commonly called *examples* or *instances*, are typically denoted $\\boldsymbol{x}$.\n",
    "The goal is to produce a model $f_\\theta$ that maps an input $\\boldsymbol{x}$ to a prediction $f_{\\theta}(\\boldsymbol{x})$\n",
    "\n",
    "To ground this description in a concrete example,\n",
    "if we were working in healthcare,\n",
    "then we might want to predict whether or not a patient would have a heart attack. \n",
    "This observation, *heart attack* or *no heart attack*,\n",
    "would be our label $y$.\n",
    "The input data $\\boldsymbol{x}$ might be vital signs such as heart rate, diastolic and systolic blood pressure, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "The supervision comes into play because for choosing the parameters $\\theta$, we (the supervisors) provide the model with a collection of *labeled examples* ($\\boldsymbol{x}_i, y_i$), where each example $\\boldsymbol{x}_i$ is matched up against it's correct label.\n",
    "\n",
    "In probabilistic terms, we typically are interested estimating \n",
    "the conditional probability $P(y|x)$. \n",
    "While it's just one among several approaches to machine learning, \n",
    "supervised learning accounts for the majority of machine learning in practice. \n",
    "Partly, that's because many important tasks \n",
    "can be described crisply as estimating the probability of some unknown given some available evidence: \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Predict cancer vs not cancer, given a CT image.** \n",
    "* **Predict the correct translation in French, given a sentence in English.**\n",
    "* **Predict the price of a stock next month based on this month's financial reporting data.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Even with the simple description \"predict targets from inputs\" \n",
    "supervised learning can take a great many forms and require a great many modeling decisions,\n",
    "depending on the type, size, and the number of inputs and outputs. \n",
    "For example, we use different models to process sequences (like strings of text or time series data)\n",
    "and for processing fixed-length vector representations.\n",
    "We'll visit many of these problems in depth throughout the first 9 parts of this book. \n",
    "\n",
    "Put plainly, the learning process looks something like this.\n",
    "Grab a big pile of example inputs, selecting them randomly.\n",
    "Acquire the ground truth labels for each.\n",
    "Together, these inputs and corresponding labels (the desired outputs)\n",
    "comprise the training set. \n",
    "We feed the training dataset into a supervised learning algorithm.\n",
    "So here the *supervised learning algorithm* is a function that takes as input a dataset,\n",
    "and outputs another function, *the learned model*. \n",
    "Then, given a learned model, \n",
    "we can take a new previously unseen input, and predict the corresponding label.\n",

    "### Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps the simplest supervised learning task to wrap your head around is Regression.\n",
    "Consider, for example a set of data harvested \n",
    "from a database of home sales.\n",
    "We might construct a table, where each row corresponds to a different house, \n",
    "and each column corresponds to some relvant attribute,\n",
    "such as the square footage of a house, the number of bedrooms, the number of bathrooms,\n",
    "and the number of minutes (walking) to the center of town. \n",
    "Formally, we call one column in this dataset a *feature vector*,\n",
    "and the object (e.g. a house) it's associated with an *example*.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you live in New York or San Francisco, and you are not the CEO of Amazon, Google, Microsoft, or Facebook, \n",
    "the (sq. footage, no. of bedrooms, no. of bathrooms, walking distance) feature vector for your home \n",
    "might look something like: $[100, 0, .5, 60]$. \n",
    "However, if you live in Pittsburgh, \n",
    "it might look more like $[3000, 4, 3, 10]$.\n",
    "Feature vectors like this are essential for all the classic machine learning problems.\n",
    "We'll typically denote the feature vector for any one example $\\mathbf{x_i}$\n",
    "and the set of feature vectors for all our examples $X$.\n",
    "\n",
    "What makes a problem *regression* is actually the outputs.\n",
    "Say that you're in the market for a new home, \n",
    "you might want to estimate the fair market value of a house,\n",
    "given some features like these. \n",
    "The target value, the price of sale, is a *real number*.\n",
    "We denote any individual target $y_i$ (corresponding to example $\\mathbf{x_i}$) \n",
    "and the set of all targets $\\mathbf{y}$ (corresponding to all examples X). \n",
    "When our targets take on arbitrary real values in some range, \n",
    "we call this a regression problem. \n",
    "The goal of our model is to produce predictions (guesses of the price, in our example)\n",
    "that closely approximate the actual target values.  \n",
    "We denote these predictions $\\hat{y}_i$ \n",
    "and if the notation seems unfamiliar, then just ignore it for now. \n",
    "We'll unpack it more thoroughly in the subsequent chapters.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Lots of practical problems are well-described regression problems. \n",
    "Predicting the rating that a user will assign to a movie is a regression problem,\n",
    "and if you designed a great algorithm to accomplish this feat in 2009,\n",
    "you might have won the [$1 million Netflix prize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix_Prize).\n",
    "Predicting the length of stay for patients in the hospital is also a regression problem.\n",
    "A good rule of thumb is that any *How much?* or *How many?* problem should suggest regression.\n",
    "* \"How many hours will this surgery take?\"... *regression*\n",
    "* \"How many dogs are in this photo?\" ... *regression*.\n",
    "However, if you can easily pose your problem as \"Is this a ___?\", then it's likely, classification, a different fundamental problem type that we'll cover next.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if you've never worked with machine learning before, \n",
    "you've probably worked through a regression problem informally. \n",
    "Imagine, for example, that you had your drains repaired \n",
    "and that your contractor, spent $x_1=3$ hours removing gunk from your sewage pipes.\n",
    "Then she sent you a bill of $y_1 = \\$350$. \n",
    "Now imagine that your friend hired the same contractor for $x_2 = 2$ hours \n",
    "and that she received a bill of $y_2 = \\$250$. \n",
    "If someone then asked you how much to expect on their upcoming gunk-removal invoice\n",
    "you might make some reasonable assumptions, \n",
    "such as more hours worked costs more dollars.\n",
    "You might also assume that there's some base charge and that the contractor then charges per hour.\n",
    "If these assumptions held, then given these two data points, \n",
    "you could already identify the contractor's pricing structure: \n",
    "\\$100 per hour plus \\$50 to show up at your house. \n",
    "If you followed that much then you already understand the high-level idea behind linear regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, we could produce the parameters that exactly matched the contractor's prices. \n",
    "Sometimes that's not possible, e.g., if some of the variance owes to some factors besides your two features.\n",
    "In these cases, we'll try to learn models that minimize the distance between our predictions and the observed values.\n",
    "In most of our chapters, we'll focus on one of two very common losses, the [L1 loss](http://mxnet.io/api/python/gluon.html#mxnet.gluon.loss.L1Loss) where $l(y,y') = \\sum_i |y_i-y_i'|$ and the [L2 loss](http://mxnet.io/api/python/gluon.html#mxnet.gluon.loss.L2Loss) where $l(y,y') = \\sum_i (y_i - y_i')^2$.\n",
    "As we will see later, the $L_2$ loss corresponds to the assumption that our data was corrupted by Gaussian noise, whereas the $L_1$ loss corresponds to an assumption of noise from a Laplace distribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "While regression models are great for addressing *how many?* questions, \n",
    "lots of problems don't bend comfortably to this template. For example, \n",
    "a bank wants to add check scanning to their mobile app. \n",
    "This would involve the customer snapping a photo of a check with their smartphone's camera \n",
    "and the machine learning model would need to be able to automatically understand text seen in the image. \n",
    "It would also need to understand hand-written text to be even more robust. \n",
    "This kind of system is referred to as optical character recognition (OCR), \n",
    "and the kind of problem it solves is called a classification. \n",
    "It's treated with a distinct set of algorithms than those that are used for regression. \n",
    "\n",
    "In classification, we want to look at a feature vector, like the pixel values in an image, \n",
    "and then predict which category (formally called *classes*), \n",
    "among some set of options, an example belongs.\n",
    "For hand-written digits, we might have 10 classes, \n",
    "corresponding to the digits 0 through 9.\n",
    "The simplest form of classification is when there are only two classes, \n",
    "a problem which we call binary classification.\n",
    "For example, our dataset $X$ could consist of images of animals \n",
    "and our *labels* $Y$ might be the classes $\\mathrm{\\{cat, dog\\}}$.\n",
    "While in regression, we sought a regressor to output a real value $\\hat{y}$,\n",

We really care about the ordering of the relevant search results and our learning algorithm needs to produce ordered subsets of elements from a larger set.

    "Reinforcment learning gives a very general statement of a problem,\n",
    "in which an agent interacts with an environment over a series of *time steps*.\n",

The interviewer asked him to code up Fizz Buzz. This is a children's game where the players count from 1 to 100 and will say *'fizz'* whenever the number is divisible by 3, *'buzz'* whenever it is divisible by 5, and *'fizzbuzz'* whenever it satisfies both criteria. Otherwise, they will just state the number. It looks like this:\n",
