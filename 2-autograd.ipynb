    "In machine learning, we *train* models to get better and better as a function of experience. Usually, *getting better* means minimizing a *loss function*, i.e. a score that answers \"how *bad* our model?\" With neural networks, we choose loss functions to be differentiable with respect to our parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Put simply, this means that for each of the model's parameters, we can determine how much *increasing* or *decreasing* it might affect the loss. While the calculations are straightforward, for complex models, working it our by hand can be a pain.\n",

    "_MXNet_'s autograd package expedites this work by automatically calculating derivatives. And while most other libraries require tha we compile a symbolic graph to take automatic derivatives, ``mxnet.autograd``, like PyTorch, allows you to take derivatives while writing  ordinary imperative code.\n",

At other times, we may be interested in the gradient of ``z`` with respect to ``x``, where ``z`` is a function of ``y``. Recall that by the train rule dz/dx can be expressed in terms of dz/dy and dy/dx. So, when ``y`` is part of a larger function ``z``, and we want ``x.grad`` to store dz/dx, we can pass in the *head gradient* dz/dy as an input to ``backward()``.
