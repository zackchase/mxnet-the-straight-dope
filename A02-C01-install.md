# Run these tutorials

## Minimal requirements
Each tutorial consists of a Jupyter notebook, which is editable and
runnable. To run these notebooks, you must have `python` installed.
Additionally, you'll need `jupyter` and a recent version of `mxnet`.
The following commands install them through `pip` (on local directory):

```bash
# optional: update pip to the newest version
sudo pip install --upgrade pip
# install jupyter
pip install jupyter --user
# install the nightly built mxnet
pip install mxnet --user
```

After completing installation, you're ready to obtain and run the source code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zackchase/mxnet-the-straight-dope/
cd mxnet-the-straight-dope
jupyter notebook
```

The last command starts the Jupyter notebook. You can now run and edit the
notebooks in a web browser, often by the URL [http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888).

Pro tip: if you'd like to run your notebook on some other port (than 8888),
launch it with:

```bash
jupyter notebook --port <port_number>
```

## Editing markdown format notebooks

Some notebooks are saved in the markdown `.md` format to make code merging
easier. We can use the [notedown](https://github.com/mli/notedown) plugin
for `jupyter` to edit markdown files directly. We recommended to use our
slightly modified version.

```bash
# remove notedown if installed before. We may get an error message saying that
# notedown is not installed before, we can just ignore it
pip uninstall -y notedown
# install our modified version
pip install https://github.com/mli/notedown/tarball/master
```

Now adding the plugin into jupyter

```bash
echo "c.NotebookApp.contents_manager_class = 'notedown.NotedownContentsManager'" >>~/.jupyter/jupyter_notebook_config.py
```

## GPU supports

The default `MXNet` package only supports CPU but some tutorials require
GPUs. If you are running on a computer that has a GPU and either CUDA 7.5
or 8.0 is installed, then the following commands install a GPU-enabled
version of MXNet.

```bash
pip install mxnet-cu75 --pre --user  # for CUDA 7.5
pip install mxnet-cu80 --pre --user  # for CUDA 8.0
```

## Run jupyter on a remote server

If you're running the notebooks on a server,
then you might want to ssh with the `-L` flag to tie `localhost:8888`
on your machine and on the server:

```
ssh myserver -L 8888:localhost:8888
```

Now we can open [http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888) to edit and run the notebooks on remote
server as before.
