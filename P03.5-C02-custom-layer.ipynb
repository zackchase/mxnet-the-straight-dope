    "# Designing a custom layer with ``gluon`` \n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've peeled back some of the syntactic sugar conferred by ``nn.Sequential()`` and given you a feeling for how ``gluon`` works under the hood, you might feel more comfortable when writing your high-level code. But the real reason to get to know ``gluon`` more intimately is so that we can mess around with it and write our own Blocks. \n",
    "\n",
    "Up until now, we've presented two versions of each tutorial. One from scratch and one in ``gluon``. Empowered with such independence, you might be wondering, \"if I wanted to write my own layer, why wouldn't I just do it from scratch?\" \n",
    "\n",
    "In reality, writing every model completely from scratch can be cumbersome.  Just like there's only so many times a developer can code up a blog from scratch without hating life, there's only so many times that you'll want to write out a convolutional layer, or define the stochastic gradient descent updates. Even in pure research environment, we usually want to customize one part of the model. For example, we might want to implement a new layer, but still rely on other common layers, loss functions, optimizers, etc. In some cases it might be nontrivial to compute the gradient efficiently and the automatic differentiation subsystem might need some help: When was the last time you performed backprop through a log-determinant, a Cholesky factorization, or a matrix exponential? In other cases things might not be numerically very stable when calculated straightforwardly (e.g. taking logs of exponentials of some arguments). \n",
    "\n",
    "By hacking ``gluon``, we can get the desired flexibility in one part of our model, without screwing up everything else that makes our life easy. "
