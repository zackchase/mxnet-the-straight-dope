## Long short-term memory (LSTM) RNNs

[Placeholder for explanation]

$$g_t = \text{tanh}(X_t W_{xg} + b_g)$$
$$i_t = \sigma(X_t W_{xi} + b_i)$$
$$f_t = \sigma(X_t W_{xf} + b_f)$$
$$o_t = \sigma(X_t W_{xo} + b_o)$$
$$c_t = f \odot c_{t-1} + g_t \odot i_t$$

## Softmax Activation

```{.python .input  n=62}

    exp = nd.exp(lin)

## Define the model

```{.python .input  n=63}

## Cross-entropy loss function

```{.python .input  n=64}
def cross_entropy(yhat, y):
    return - nd.mean(nd.sum(y * nd.log(yhat), axis=0, exclude=True))

## Averaging the loss over the sequence

```{.python .input  n=65}

## Optimizer

```{.python .input  n=66}

```
