    "Legendre first developed the method of least squares regression in 1805,\n",
    "which was shortly thereafter rediscovered by Gauss in 1809. \n",
    "Presumably, Legendre, who had Tweeted about the paper several times,\n",
    "was peeved that Gauss failed to cite his arXiv preprint. \n",

    "worked on linear regression, does that mean there were the original deep learning researchers?\n",
    "And if linear regression doesn't wholly belong to deep learning, \n",
    "then why are we presenting a linear model \n",
    "as the first example in a tutorial series on neural networks? \n",
    "Well it turns out that we can express linear regression \n",
    "as the simplest possible (useful) neural network. \n",
    "A neural network is just a collection of nodes (aka neurons) connected by directed edges. \n",
    "In most networks, we arrange the nodes into layers with each feeding its output into the layer above. \n",
    "To calculate the value of any node, we first perform a weighted sum of the inputs (according to weights ``w``) \n",
    "and then apply an *activation function*. \n",
    "For linear regression, we only have two layers, one corresponding to the input (depicted in orange) \n",
    "and a one-node layer (depicted in green) correspnding to the ouput.\n",

Another way of saying this is that they will have diagonal covariance.  The labels will be generated accoding to the *true* labeling function `y[i] = 2 * X[i][0]- 3.4 * X[i][1] + 4.2 + noise` where the noise is drawn from a random gaussian with mean ``0`` and variance ``.01``.

    "You've seen that using just mxnet.ndarray and mxnet.autograd, we can build statistical models from scratch. In the following tutorials, we'll build on this foundation, introducing the basic ideas behind modern neural networks and demonstrating the powerful abstractions in MXNet's `gluon` package for building complex models with little code.
