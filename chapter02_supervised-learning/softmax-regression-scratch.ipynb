    "# Multiclass logistic regression from scratch\n",
    "\n",
    "If you've made it through our tutorials on linear regression from scratch, then you're past the hardest part. You already know how to load and manipulate data, build computation graphs on the fly, and take derivatives. You also know how to define a loss function, construct a model, and write your own optimizer. Nearly all neural networks that we'll build in the real world consist of these same fundamental parts. The main differences will be the type and scale of the data and the complexity of the models. And every year or two, a new hipster optimizer comes around, but at their core they're all subtle variations of stochastic gradient descent.\n",
    "\n",
    "In [the previous chapter](logistic-regressio-gluon.ipynb), we introduced logistic regression, a classic algorithm for performing binary classification.\n",
    "We implemented a model \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hat{y} = \\sigma( \\boldsymbol{x} \\boldsymbol{w}^T + b)$$\n",
    "where $\\sigma$ is the sigmoid squashing function.\n",
    "\n",
    "This activation function on the final layer was crucial because it forced our outputs to take values in the range [0,1]. That allowed us to interpret these outputs as probabilties.\n",
    "We then updated our parameters to give the true labels (which take values either 1 or 0)\n",
    "the highest probability.\n",
    "In that tutorial, we looked at predicting whether or not an individual's income exceeded $50k based on features available in 1994 census data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Binary classification is quite useful. We can use it to predict spam vs. not spam\n",
    "or cancer vs not cancer. \n",
    "But not every problem fits the mold of binary classification. \n",
    "Sometimes we encounter a problem where each example could belong to one of $k$ classes.\n",
    "For example, a photograph might depict a cat or a dog or a zebra or ... (you get the point).\n",
    "Given $k$ classes, the most naive way to solve a *multiclass classification* problem \n",
    "is to train $k$ different binary classifiers $f_i(\\boldsymbol{x})$. \n",
    "We could then predict that an example $\\boldsymbol{x}$ belongs \n",
    "to the class $i$ for which the probability that the label applies is highest:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\max_i {f_i(\\boldsymbol{x})}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "There's a smarter way to go about this. \n",
    "We could force the output layer to be a discrete probability distribution over the $k$ classes.\n",
    "To be a valid probability distribution, we'll want the output $\\hat{y}$ to (i) contain only non-negative values, and (ii) sum to 1. We accomplish this by using the *softmax* function.\n",
    "Given an input vector $z$, softmax does two things. \n",
    "First, it exponentiates (elementwise) $e^{z}$, forcing all values to be strictly positive.\n",
    "Then it normalizes so that all values sum to $1$.\n",
    "Following the softmax operation computes the following\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{softmax}(\\boldsymbol{z}) = \\frac{e^{\\boldsymbol{z}} }{\\sum_{i=1}^k e^{z_i}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Because now we have $k$ outputs and not $1$ we'll need weights connecting each of our inputs to each of our outputs. Graphically, the network looks something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://github.com/zackchase/mxnet-the-straight-dope/blob/master/img/simple-softmax-net.png?raw=true)\n",
    "\n",
    "We can represent these weights one for each input node, output node pair in a matrix $W$.\n",
    "We generate the linear mapping from inputs to outputs via a matrix-vector product $\\boldsymbol{x} W + \\boldsymbol{b}$. Note that the bias term is now a vector, with one component for each output node.\n",
    "The whole model, including the activation function can be written:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hat{y} = \\text{softmax}(\\boldsymbol{x} W + \\boldsymbol{b})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This model is sometimes called *multiclass logistic regression*. \n",
    "Other common names for it include *softmax regression* and *multinomial regression*.\n",
    "For these concepts to sink in, let's actually implement softmax regression,\n",
