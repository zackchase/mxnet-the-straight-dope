While it's good to know how to do things from scratch, with ``gluon``, we can just compose a network from predefined layers. For a linear model, the appropriate layer is called ``Dense``. It's called a *dense* layer because every node in the input is connected to every node in the subsequent layer. That description seems excessive because we only have one output here. But in most subsequent chapters we'll work with networks that have multiple outputs.\n",

We'll delve deeper into these details later when we actually have more than one layer to work with (we could have multiple parallel branches, long chains, etc.). For now let's just instantiate the ``Sequential``."
