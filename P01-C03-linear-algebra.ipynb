Assign vector represenatations to items (like words, products, or news articles) such that the distance between similar items is minimized, and the distance between dissimilar times is maximized. Oftentimes, these objectives, perhaps the most important component of a machine learning algorithm (besides the data itself), are expressed as norms.\n"

And a lot of that math *is* useful for machine learning. For example, matrices can be decomposed into factors, and these decompositions can reveal low-dimensinoal structure in real-world datasets. There are entire subfields of machine learning that focus on using matrix decompositions and their generalizations to high-order tesors to discover structure in datasets and solve prediction problems. But this book focuses on deep learning. And we believe you'll be much more inclined to learn more mathematics once you've gotten your hands dirty deploying useful machine learning models on real datasets. So while reserve the right to introduce more math much later on, we'll wrap up this chapter here."
