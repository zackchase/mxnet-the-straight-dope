    "When you train a linear model, you update the weights\n",
    "in order to optimize some objective.\n",
    "And for the linear model, \n",
    "the distribution of the inputs stays the same throughout training.\n",
    "So all we have to worry about is how to map \n",
    "from these well-behaved inputs to some appropriate outputs.\n",
    "But if we focus on some layer in the middle of a deep neural network,\n",
    "for example the third,\n",
    "things look a bit different. \n",
    "After each training iteration, \n",
    "we update the weights in all the layers, including the first and the second.\n",
    "That means that over the course of training,\n",
    "as the weights for the first two layers are learned,\n",
    "the inputs to the third layer might look dramatically different than they did at the beginning.\n",
    "For starters, they might take values on a scale orders of magnitudes different from when we started training.\n",
    "And this shift in feature scale might have serious implications, say for the ideal learning rate at each time. \n",
    "\n",
    "To explain, let us consider the Taylor's expansion for the objective function $f$ with respect to the updated parameter $\\mathbf{w}$, such as $f(\\mathbf{w} - \\eta \\nabla f(\\mathbf{w}))$. Coefficients of those higher-order terms with respect to the learning rate $\\eta$ may be so large in scale (usually due to many layers) that these terms cannot be ignored. However, the effect of common lower-order optimization algorithms, such as gradient descent, in iteratively reducing the objective function is based on an important assumption: all those higher-order terms with respect to the learning rate in the aforementioned Taylor's expansion are ignored.\n",

    "Motivated by this sort of intuition, \n",
    "Sergey Ioffe and Christian Szegedy proposed [Batch Normalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03167),\n",
    "a technique that normalizes the mean and variance of each of the features at every level of representation during training. \n",
    "The technique involves normalization of the features across the examples in each mini-batch.\n",
    "While competing explanations for the technique's effect abound,\n",
    "its success is hard to deny.\n",
    "Empirically it appears to stabilize the gradient (less exploding or vanishing values)\n",
    "and batch-normalized models appear to overfit less.\n",
    "In fact, batch-normalized models seldom even use dropout. \n",
